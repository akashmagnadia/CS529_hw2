    <h1> About this project </h1>
    <p>
        This project intends to help me better understand the decisions that designers make when they consider
        visual encodings and the decisions they make to represent the information in a particular form.
        This exercise will help me understand the Ethics of Visual Data Science by trying to create misleading
        visualization, analyzing, and then fixing it to make it more ethical.

        As can be seen from the picture on the left, I intentionally tried to create a misleading visualization.
        My role was to sway the opinion of the user to a bias that was set by me.
        One of the opinions is the title itself, which tells the users that males are more
        likely to be murdered if they live in the United States of America.
        I purposely chose the continuous color scale to be only blue to show that only men are being murdered.
        This is amplified by the only color blue being used for the scale as there is a stereotype of blue color being associated with males.
        Therefore, seeing states filled with only blue color would make an association that only men are being murdered and not women.
        I also included the hardest font to read for the legends and tried to put it in a odd position so the natural
        instincts would be to look at the color scale and make assumptions, which in this case would be false assumptions.
        The dots represent murders in the city and the size represents how many murders were done compared to other states without population normalization.
        This would mean that where more population lies more murders happen and my intention behind picking a hard red color would signify blood on the East Coast.
        This is further hinted at by including the yellow text that calls out murders on the East Coast.
        Lastly, I put the dots for murders on top of the yellow text to serve as blood stains but also as statistics about murders happening on the East Coast.
        Therefore, using the techniques described above I tried to create a biased visualization that didn't clearly show the data accurately.

        This visualization attempts to correct many mistakes made in the previous black hat visualization.
        Here the text is readable, making the website pleasing to look at.
        When the user enters this website, they are not bombarded with information and this is due to the
        the minimalist approach that I have taken with this visualization.
        The information is only served when it's needed and asked by the user by hovering over the state.
        The map shows data regarding the ratio of murder death between males and females.
        Intuitively, blue is associated with males and red is with the female.
        This design is further enhanced by creating the correct male-to-female color ratio under the map and
        putting labels in Arial font with white text to make it easier to read.
        With this particular visualization, users can hover over each of the states to get further details on the
        ratio of death between genders with actual numbers and percentage information.
        The tooltip also reflects the color gradient of the state to give another dimension of indirect information to the tooltip.
